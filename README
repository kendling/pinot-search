Pinot, http://pinot.berlios.de/

Pinot is a metasearch tool for the X-Window desktop. It acts as a front-end for
search engines such as Google (with support for the SOAP API), All The Web,
Ask Jeeves, etc.. and allows one to index relevant results locally and query
the index.
It was developed and tested on GNU/Linux and should work on other Unix-like systems.

FAQ :
-----

- When listing an index or indexing documents, Pinot complains of an
  "index error"
  This is likely because a previous instance didn't exit properly and one
  (or more) index is still locked. Quit Pinot and look for a "db_lock" file
  in "~/.pinot/index" and "~/.pinot/mail". If it's there, delete it and
  restart Pinot. This will be fixed in the future.

- When compiling from source, you may run into linking problems related to
  libstdc++.la. Try patching xapian-config as explained in this post
  (http://lists.tartarus.org/pipermail/xapian-devel/2006-January/000293.html).

- If you experience segfaults at startup and you are on Fedora, chances are
  it's because of libxml++/libsigc++. See this Bugzilla entry:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=178592
  The latest version seems to fix this issue.

- If you have built Pinot from source, make sure you have done a "make install".
  Pinot will fail to start if it can't find stuff it needs, its icon for instance.
