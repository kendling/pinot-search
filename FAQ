  * At startup, when listing an index or indexing documents, Pinot complains
    of an "index error"
    This is likely because a previous instance didn't exit properly and one
    (or more) index is still locked. Quit Pinot and look for a "db_lock",
    "flicklock" or "flintlock" file (depending on what version of Xapian the
    index was created with/is currently installed) in the directory that Pinot
    complains about. If it's there, check that no other process is using this
    file, delete it and restart Pinot.

  * When compiling from source, you may run into linking problems related to
    libstdc++.la. Try patching xapian-config as explained in the post at
    http://lists.tartarus.org/pipermail/xapian-devel/2006-January/000293.html

  * If you experience segfaults at startup and you are on Fedora, chances are
    it's because of libxml++/libsigc++. See this Bugzilla entry :
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=178592
    The latest version seems to fix this issue.

  * If the daemon crashes seemingly randomly while indexing, it may be because
    SQLite wasn't built thread-safe. I have witnessed this mostly on dual CPU
    machines, but others are not immune. Try rebuilding SQLite by passing
    "--enable-threadsafe --enable-threads-override-locks" to configure.

  * If you have built Pinot from source, make sure you have done a "make install".
    Pinot will fail to start if it can't find stuff it needs, its icon for
    instance.

  * If "make install" fails with an error about Categories in pinot.desktop
    and you have desktop-file-utils 0.11, either downgrade to 0.10 or upgrade
    to 0.12 if possible, or edit the top-level Makefile and replace the line
     @desktop-file-install --vendor="" --dir=$(DESTDIR)$(datadir)/applications pinot.desktop
    with
     $(INSTALL_DATA) pinot.desktop $(DESTDIR)$(datadir)/applications/pinot.desktop
    and run "make install" again.

  * In stored queries, the directory filter doesn't work as expected if the
    directory name starts with a non alpha-numeric character. This has been
    fixed in Xapian 0.9.8.

  * On FreeBSD, threading issues may cause the daemon to crash unexpectedly.
    A fix is to add the following lines to /etc/libmap.conf (which may not exist) :
     [/usr/local/bin/pinot-dbus-daemon]
     libpthread.so.2         libc_r.so.6
     libpthread.so           libc_r.so

     [/usr/local/bin/pinot]
     libpthread.so.2         libc_r.so.6
     libpthread.so           libc_r.so

  * If you are using KDE 3.* and pinot-dbus-daemon does not autostart, symlink
    the file /etc/xdg/autostart/pinot-dbus-daemon.desktop to either
    $(kde-config --prefix)/share/autostart (for all users) or ~/.kde/Autostart
    (current user only).

  * Flushing is not directly configurable in Pinot, but some control is
    possible with the environment variable XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD. It can be
    set to the number of documents after which changes should be flushed to the
    index. The default value is 10000.
    The daemon explicitely flushes the index once it has crawled one of the
    directories configured in Preferences, Indexing. if this directory has more
    documents than XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD, changes will be buffered in RAM until
    the directory is fully crawled.
