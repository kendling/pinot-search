General
- Fix the FIXMEs
- Get rid of dead code/classes/methods...
- Advertise service via Rendezvous
- Man page, see help2man (http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/)
- Logging should not be all (DEBUG) or nothing (release)
- Check for leaks with valgrind (eg --tool=memcheck -v --leak-check=yes --show-reachable=yes ...)
- Change .spec to allow building with Google and ObjectsSearch SOAP APIs support
- Don't use system(), fork and exec, especially for the external browser
- Find out how to determine what application to use for a given MIME type and drop internal browser
  Does xdgmime allow to consult the applications/types mappings in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
  and mimeinfo.cache ?
- MIMEScanner should also return parent types so that we don't filter out types unnecessarily
- Make sure everything works with URLs/path names that include spaces or unusual characters

Search
- Write a Spirit-based parser for extracting results from web pages
- Allow to use "extended" INTERPRET tags selectively 
- With engines that provide a redirection URL for results (eg Acoona), it looks like
  the query hitory is not saved/checked correctly
- Add Creative Commons (http://search.yahoo.com/cc)
- Add http://www.patentcommons.org/commons/patentsearch.php
- Implement AutoDiscovery of OpenSearch Description files (http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/1.1/description/)
- Support for Google Buttons
- Make sure Description files' SyndicationRight is not private or closed
- Export search results as OpenSearch Response

Collect
- Comply with robot stuff defined at http://www.robotstxt.org/
- Harvest mode grabs all pages on a specific site down to a certain depth
- Make User-Agent string configurable
- Make download timeout configurable
- Support for HTML frames
- Allow to cache documents that had to be converted ? eg PDF, MS Word
- Use poppler for the PDF tokenizer
- WordPerfect tokenizer with libwpd

Index
- Get hold of stopwords lists for the languages supported by Xapian's stemmers and don't index stop words
- Allow to import and use omindex-produced indexes  so that they can be used like pinot's internal indexes
- Write a pseudo-filesystem for indexes with FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) or gnome-vfs ?
- Interface with libtranslate (http://www.nongnu.org/libtranslate/) ? :-)
- Xapian lock files can be deleted at startup if no other instance is running
- Play around with the XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD env var
- Switch to Xapian's new Flint back-end (set XAPIAN_PREFER_FLINT=1)
- Write a back-end for CLucene (http://clucene.sourceforge.net/)
- Flush the index before searching not after modification
- Hash document data to determine on updates whether documents have changed
- Allow to monitor imported documents for changes
- Flush after a properties update; not doing so seems to prevent abstract generation from working
 correctly, as terms positions can't be obtained
- Xapian Query objects will become serializable at some point, this will be useful
  for stored queries
- Think about indexing archives (parent documents) and their contents (child documents)
- Add a "more like this" menu to results from an index to get related documents

Browser plugin
- Write Firefox extension that searches Pinot indexes and indexes the cache
- Borrow code from beagle's Firefox plugin
- Skip popups and non text documents
- Use dbus for communication
- Index browser history in My Web index

Mail
- Find out what kind of locking scheme Mozilla uses (POSIX lock ?) and use that
- Index Evolution email (Camel, might be useful for other types actually)
- Keep track of attachments and avoid indexing the same file twice
- Append sender to title or use as host name ?
- Decypher and use Mozilla's mailbox scheme, eg
  mailbox://mbox_file_name?number=2164959&part=1.2&type=text/plain&filename=portability.txt
- When parsing email's Date field, take the timezone offset into account, eg in
    Date: Thu, 25 Aug 2005 11:04:49 +0800
  +0800 is basically same as SGT. At the moment the date is assumed to be GMT !
- Mail messages with attachements are not indexed

UI
- Switching back and forth between grouping modes messes up results rankings : check scores
- When sorting results by host name, give better score to results that appear several times
- Results and index trees should be sorted when clicking on columns
- Show which threads are running, what they are doing, and allow to stop them selectively
- Add an history window to edit Index and ViewHistory
- Automatic indexing of a query's results depending on type, source, size, language
- Non modal status window to display log of operations
- Display search engines icons (Gtk::IconSource::set_filename() and Gtk::Style::render_icon())
- Replace Combobox objects with ComboboxText's (glademm support required)
- Replace glademm with libglademm ?
- Show activity when mail is being indexed
- Update Last Run after the query has completed
- Filter documents by language, similarly to how labels are shown
- Save engines groups state in config file
- Clean up method names
- Prefer ustring to string whenever possible
- Closing when threads are running gives the impression Pinot has crashed; how do we tell the user
  we are waiting for something to finish ?
- Try sizing the window optimally on the first startup
- Use libnotify to show a popup when a new result is available ?
- Replace labels with tags (Leaftag, http://www.chipx86.com/wiki/Leaftag)
- Enable to import all the documents that match a specific tag
- Double click on a word in the extract field adds it to the live query field
