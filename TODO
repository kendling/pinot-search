Documentation
- List what files from libtextcat 2.2 go where ?
- Say where libtextcat 3.0 can (and cannot ;-) be found
- MIME type should be as returned by xdg-utils' 'xdg-mime query filetype ...'
- Try listing names of dependency packages for most distros
- How to trouble-shoot with delve, get to a file with filters and labels
- Explain when indexing and updating are done, eg in the results list, Index on
 a result already indexed doesn't update it

General
- Fix the FIXMEs
- Get rid of dead code/classes/methods...
- Advertise service via Rendezvous
- Extend metadata beyond title,location,language,type,timestamp,size
- Don't package gmo files, they are platform dependent
- CLI programs to use tty highlighting if available

Barpanel
- Write a plugin for barpanel http://www.igelle.org/barpanel/

Tokenize
- Allow to cache documents that had to be converted ? eg PDF, MS Word
- Write a PDF filter that handles columns correctly, with poppler ?
- WordPerfect filter with libwpd
- Office filter with libgst
- TeX filter
- HtmlFilter to look for META tags Author, Creator, Publisher and CreationDate
- Filters should have a version number so that new versions force reindexing documents of the
 given type
- XmlFilter is slow-ish, rewrite file parsing with the TextReader interface
- Filters should at least return errno when they fail

SQL
- Move history files into the index directories

Monitor
- Implement support for Solaris FEM

Collect
- Comply with robot stuff defined at http://www.robotstxt.org/
- Harvest mode grabs all pages on a specific site down to a certain depth
- Make User-Agent string configurable
- Make download timeout configurable
- Support for HTML frames
- Test NeonDownloader

Search
- With engines that provide a redirection URL for results (eg Acoona), it looks like
  the query hitory is not saved/checked correctly
- Make sure Description files' SyndicationRight is not private or closed
- getCloseTerms() should be a search engine method so that WebEngine can use plugins'
 suggestions Url field (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Supporting_search_suggestions_in_search_plugins)
- pinot-search should be able to run stored queries, as found in the configuration file
- Filters with CJKV should work better; supporting quoting would help, eg title:"你好"

Index
- Play around with the XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD env var
- MD5 hash to determine on updates whether documents have changed, as done by omindex
- Allow to access remote Xapian indexes tunneled through ssh with xapian-progsrv,
  and make sure ssh will ask passwords with /usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-askpass
- Index xattrs if any
- Index Nautilus metadata (http://linuxboxadmin.com/articles/nautilus.php)
- Reverse terms so that left wildcards can be applied ?
- XapianIndex could do with some common code refactoring
- Automatically categorize documents based on MIME type and source into picture, video, etc...
- After indexing or updating a document, a call to getDocumentInfo() shouldn't be necessary
- Labels and the rest of DocumentInfo are handled separately, they shouldn't be
- Indexes have no knowledge of indexId's
- Send a signal when crawling is done so that the UI can reopen the index
- Be ready to catch DatabaseModifiedError exceptions and reopen the index
- Associate URIs or IDs to labels to avoid expensive find and replace operations when they are renamed
- Force reindexing on 0.90 to make sure all CJKV fixes are taken advantage of

Mail
- Find out what kind of locking scheme Mozilla uses (POSIX lock ?) and use that
- Index Evolution email (Camel, might be useful for other types actually)
- Index mail headers
- Decypher and use Mozilla's mailbox scheme, eg
  mailbox://mbox_file_name?number=2164959&part=1.2&type=text/plain&filename=portability.txt
- Keep track of attachments and avoid indexing the same file twice
- Mailboxes where all messages are flagged by Mozilla/that are empty are not indexed at all

Daemon
- Allow building without the daemon
- Enable to deactivate D-Bus interface
- Clean up method names
- Prefer ustring to string whenever possible
- Queue unindexing too
- Follow updates to Xesam specs
- Preserve user set metadata on reindexing

UI
- Show which threads are running, what they are doing, and allow to stop them
 selectively
- Display search engines icons (Gtk::IconSource::set_filename() and Gtk::Style::render_icon())
- Replace glademm with libglademm ?
- Use unique (http://www.gnome.org/~ebassi/source/) if available
- Either Live Query behaves like a live query (eg results list updated when new
 documents match) or it is renamed to something else to avoid confusion
- When viewing or indexing a result, all rows for that same URL should be updated with
 the Viewed or Indexed icons (the latter after IndexingThread returns)
- Make use of GTKmm 2.10 StatusIcon
- UI doesn't show documents indexed by the daemon the very first time it's run,
 at least until it's restarted
- Unknown exceptions in IndexingThread or elsewhere should be logged as errors
- Delete all temporary files when exiting
- Query expansion should be interactive
- Default cache provider should be configurable
- Reorganize menus so that More Like This, Search This For etc... are available
 on all documents, whether a result or from an index
- Offer to index newly mounted volumes
