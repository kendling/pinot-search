General
- Fix the FIXMEs
- Get rid of dead code/classes/methods...
- Advertise service via Rendezvous
- MIMEScanner should also return parent types so that we don't filter out types unnecessarily

Tokenize
- Allow to cache documents that had to be converted ? eg PDF, MS Word
- PDF tokenizer with poppler
- WordPerfect tokenizer with libwpd
- Spin tokenizers into separate project, a la libextractor
- Check whether pdftotext flattens text in PDF documents that have columns
- HtmlTokenizer should skip htdig_noindex blocks (http://www.htdig.org/attrs.html#noindex_start)

Monitor
- Implement support for Solaris FEM

Collect
- Comply with robot stuff defined at http://www.robotstxt.org/
- Harvest mode grabs all pages on a specific site down to a certain depth
- Make User-Agent string configurable
- Make download timeout configurable
- Support for HTML frames

Search
- Write a parser for extracting results from web pages
- Allow to use "extended" INTERPRET tags selectively 
- With engines that provide a redirection URL for results (eg Acoona), it looks like
  the query hitory is not saved/checked correctly
- Add http://www.patentcommons.org/commons/patentsearch.php
- Replace Accona with Baidu ?
- Implement AutoDiscovery of OpenSearch Description files (http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/1.1/description/)
- Make sure Description files' SyndicationRight is not private or closed
- Export search results as OpenSearch Response
- Support for Google Buttons

Index
- Get hold of stopwords lists for the languages supported by Xapian's stemmers and don't index stop words
- Allow to import and use omindex-produced indexes  so that they can be used like pinot's internal indexes
- Write a pseudo-filesystem for indexes with FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) or gnome-vfs ?
- Xapian lock files can be deleted at startup if no other instance is running
- Play around with the XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD env var
- Hash document data to determine on updates whether documents have changed
- Xapian Query objects will become serializable at some point, this will be useful
  for stored queries
- Think about indexing archives (parent documents) and their contents (child documents)
- Reopen connection to remote indexes when necessary; does Xapian throw a RemoteError ?
- Allow to access remote Xapian indexes tunneled through ssh, using Xapian::Remote::open()
  defined in /usr/include/xapian/dbfactory.h
- Use Xapian's QueryParser

Mail
- Find out what kind of locking scheme Mozilla uses (POSIX lock ?) and use that
- Index Evolution email (Camel, might be useful for other types actually)
- Keep track of attachments and avoid indexing the same file twice
- Append sender to title or use as host name ?
- Decypher and use Mozilla's mailbox scheme, eg
  mailbox://mbox_file_name?number=2164959&part=1.2&type=text/plain&filename=portability.txt
- When parsing email's Date field, take the timezone offset into account, eg in
    Date: Thu, 25 Aug 2005 11:04:49 +0800
  +0800 is basically same as SGT. At the moment the date is assumed to be GMT !
- Mail messages with attachements are not indexed

UI
- Switching back and forth between grouping modes messes up results rankings : check scores
- When sorting results by host name, give better score to results that appear several times
- Show which threads are running, what they are doing, and allow to stop them selectively
- Add an history window to edit Index and ViewHistory
- Automatic indexing of a query's results depending on type, source, size, language
- Non modal status window to display log of operations
- Display search engines icons (Gtk::IconSource::set_filename() and Gtk::Style::render_icon())
- Replace Combobox objects with ComboboxText's (glademm support required)
- Replace glademm with libglademm ?
- Filter documents by language, similarly to how labels are shown
- Clean up method names
- Prefer ustring to string whenever possible
- Closing when threads are running gives the impression Pinot has crashed; how do we tell the user
  we are waiting for something to finish ?
- Replace labels with tags (Leaftag, http://www.chipx86.com/wiki/Leaftag). Enable to import
  all the documents that match a specific tag
- When switching back and forth between results tabs and another tab, why does the
  result list get shifted right to the Title column ?
- Make Pinot a unique app (http://guniqueapp.akl.lt/)
