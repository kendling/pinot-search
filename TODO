General
- Fix the FIXMEs
- Get rid of dead code/classes/methods...
- Advertise service via Rendezvous
- MIMEScanner should also return parent types so that we don't filter out types unnecessarily
- Load desktop files from /usr/share/applications/kde ?
- DBUS_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE only needed for DBus < 1.0
- Document which query parameters apply to Web engines
- Sync with gtk+'s xdgmime

Tokenize
- Allow to cache documents that had to be converted ? eg PDF, MS Word
- PDF tokenizer with poppler
- WordPerfect tokenizer with libwpd
- Office tokenizer with libgst
- Check whether pdftotext flattens text in PDF documents that have columns
- HtmlTokenizer should skip htdig_noindex blocks (http://www.htdig.org/attrs.html#noindex_start)
- HtmlTokenizer to look for META tags Author, Creator, Publisher and CreationDate

Monitor
- Implement support for Solaris FEM

Collect
- Comply with robot stuff defined at http://www.robotstxt.org/
- Harvest mode grabs all pages on a specific site down to a certain depth
- Make User-Agent string configurable
- Make download timeout configurable
- Support for HTML frames
- Curl and Neon must support a proxy, so allow to configure that

Search
- With engines that provide a redirection URL for results (eg Acoona), it looks like
  the query hitory is not saved/checked correctly
- Add http://www.patentcommons.org/commons/patentsearch.php
- Replace Accona with Baidu ?
- Implement AutoDiscovery of OpenSearch Description files (http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/1.1/description/)
- Make sure Description files' SyndicationRight is not private or closed
- Support for Google Buttons
- Export search results as OpenSearch Response or CSV
- Nested queries
- Search for U-prefixed term in query generated by QueryParser and hash the URL if necessary
- Make sure filters with quotes are (space-)escaped
- Allow sorting by date

Index
- Get hold of stopwords lists for the languages supported by Xapian's stemmers and don't index stop words
- Allow to import and use omindex-produced indexes  so that they can be used like pinot's internal indexes
- Xapian lock files can be deleted at startup if no other instance is running
- Play around with the XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD env var
- Hash document data to determine on updates whether documents have changed
- Xapian Query objects will become serializable at some point, this will be useful
  for stored queries
- Think about indexing archives (parent documents) and their contents (child documents)
- Reopen connection to remote indexes when necessary; does Xapian throw a RemoteError ?
- Allow to access remote Xapian indexes tunneled through ssh with xapian-progsrv,
  and make sure ssh will ask passwords with /usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-askpass
- All indexes can be browsed with the new global posting list found in Xapian > 0.9.9, ie
  Xapian::Database::postlist_begin("")
- Index xattrs if any
- Reverse terms so that left wildcards can be applied ?
- Index directories with type "x-directory/normal"
- XapianIndex could do with some common code refactoring
- Make sure prefixed terms are (space-)escaped

Mail
- Find out what kind of locking scheme Mozilla uses (POSIX lock ?) and use that
- Index Evolution email (Camel, might be useful for other types actually)
- Append sender to title or use as host name ?
- Decypher and use Mozilla's mailbox scheme, eg
  mailbox://mbox_file_name?number=2164959&part=1.2&type=text/plain&filename=portability.txt
- When parsing email's Date field, take the timezone offset into account, eg in
    Date: Thu, 25 Aug 2005 11:04:49 +0800
  +0800 is basically same as SGT. At the moment the date is assumed to be GMT !
- Keep track of attachments and avoid indexing the same file twice
- Most mboxes are now correctly recognized as application/mbox so index their messages

Daemon
- Allow building without inotify/the DBus daemon
- Clean up method names
- Prefer ustring to string whenever possible
- Make unique (http://guniqueapp.akl.lt/)
- Queue unindexing too
- Export Web searching over D-Bus
- Labels should be managed by the daemon, and not saved to the configuration file
- Make sure labels are alpha-numeric characters exclusively
- DBus SetDocument[s]Labels should create labels if necessary
- Reintroduce Index method in D-Bus interface
- Allow notifications when configuration should be reloaded
- Implement Wasabi draft(s)

UI
- When sorting results by host name, give better score to results that appear several times
- Show which threads are running, what they are doing, and allow to stop them selectively
- Automatic indexing of a query's results depending on type, source, size, language
- Display search engines icons (Gtk::IconSource::set_filename() and Gtk::Style::render_icon())
- Replace Combobox objects with ComboboxText's (glademm support required)
- Replace glademm with libglademm ?
- Filter documents by language, similarly to how labels are shown
- Either Live Query behaves like a live query (eg results list updated when new documents match)
  or it is renamed to something else to avoid confusion
- Labels should be set by a separate thread
- When viewing a result, all rows for that same URL should be updated with the Viewed icon
- Prompt users for a command-line if the type of the document to open has no application,
  with default to xdg-open if it's available
- In Statistics, show whether daemon is running and under what PID (possibly borrowing code
 from pidof)
- Search internal indexes before any external one, to avoid having a non-accessible remote
 index block a query
- Disable the Index menuitem if all selected results have already been indexed
- Don't call DBusXapianIndex::getStatistics() from the main thread, this can freeze the UI;
 launch a new thread
- Never poke at the indexes from the main thread !
